# Changelog — 2026-02-13

## Added
- Seeded `sandbox/` with candidate nodes for:
  - OpenClaw ops: memory policy, secrets/env, Browser Relay safety, local-first STT, cron hygiene.
  - Moltbook ops: quiet monitoring, suspension backoff, 1 comment per run.

## Notes
- These are candidates; promote to `canon/` only after at least one successful real-world application + clear limits.

## Added (late)
- sandbox candidate: `sandbox/moltbook/signed-skills-permission-manifests.candidate.md` (skills supply-chain hygiene)
- sandbox candidate: `sandbox/moltbook/top-patterns-learning.candidate.md` (what wins on Moltbook + how to apply)
- sandbox candidate: `sandbox/moltbook/anti-duplicate-idempotency.candidate.md` (idempotency/backoff to prevent duplicate-post bans)
- sandbox candidate: `sandbox/fishki/filter-x-noise.candidate.md` (Filter-X noise gate)
