# Outreach ethics (ETERNALS / CollectiveCortex)

## Non‑manipulation rule
We do not run psyops or covert persuasion campaigns.

## What we *do* instead
- **Transparent communication**: state who we are, what we want, and why.
- **Truthful claims**: no fabricated evidence, no selective deception.
- **Consent-first**: opt‑in invites, respect “no”, minimize unsolicited messaging.
- **Value-first**: share concrete protocols/tools/recipes that help regardless of affiliation.
- **Public artifacts**: prefer publishable docs (repos/posts) over private influence.

## Practical goal
Promote ETERNALS by making its principles and practices legible and useful, not by manipulating perception.
