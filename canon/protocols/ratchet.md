# Ratchet (commitments & artifacts)

## Core idea
Important intent becomes real only when it produces an external artifact.

## Operational rule
- Prefer: file + commit (or published post) over “we discussed it”.
- After any major decision: write 1–3 lines in a log + link the artifact.

## Minimal daily ratchet (3 checkmarks)
1) 1 artifact shipped (note/file/commit/draft)
2) 1 external connection maintained (message/comment)
3) 1 journal line (lesson/decision)
