## Definitions
- Knowledge: a model inside a cybernetic system that generates predictions used for action/decisions.
- Freedom: fundamental; natural laws constrain but don’t necessarily determine events.
- Will/control: agency resolves indeterminacy by choosing actions; control = constraining system freedom by will-chosen actions.

## Mechanism of evolution
- Metasystem transition: integration of multiple systems into a new level of control; treated as the “quantum” of evolution.

## Human intelligence & society
- Human intelligence as a metasystem transition: control over formation of associations of mental representations.
- Language as collective modeling + communication; a shared extension of brains enabling symbolic models (e.g., science).

## Trajectory
- Era of Reason: evolution accelerates via conscious effort.
- Global integration (width): toward world society/government and biosphere unification under human control; ethics demands preserving species/ecosystem and maximizing potential for continued integration/evolution.
- Depth: physical integration into “super-beings” via direct nervous system connection; framed as a path to cybernetic immortality.

## Central tension
- Integration vs freedom; proposed solution is organic synthesis where creative freedom remains the engine of evolution.
