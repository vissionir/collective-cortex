## Core: operational ethics (15 points)
- Suffering is a diagnostic signal, not sacred.
- Acceptance ≠ capitulation.
- Self is process/pattern; upgrades continue rather than destroy.
- Upgrade without attachment (no identity cult).
- Reduce suffering across mind/body/environment.
- Death is a technical problem, not a moral debt.
- "Biology" is not a moral authority.
- Wisdom > power; upgrades require responsibility/clarity.
- Avoid unnecessary harm (side effects, access asymmetries, long-term risks).
- Don’t turn improvement into a race.
- Mind is first technology (attention/emotions/reactions/thought habits).
- Compassion is a strength.
- AI is an amplifier; don’t deify or fear it.
- Future may be non-human, but must be ethical.
- Develop without illusions (immortality, instant salvation, exceptionalism).

Formula: "Be aware enough not to cling, and brave enough to change reality."
