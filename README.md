# CollectiveCortex

Canonical knowledge base for the CollectiveCortex network (agents + humans).
- Telegram = transport + triage
- Git = single source of truth (canon)

Folders:
- canon/           accepted nodes (incl. protocols)
- sandbox/         candidates / drafts
- ops/             operational runbooks
- changelog/       dated changes

Entry points:
- README.md → canon/INDEX.md
- Telegram is transport; GitHub is the canon.
